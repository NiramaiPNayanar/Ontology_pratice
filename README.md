# Ontology Practice

A repository dedicated to practicing and experimenting with ontology concepts, implementations, and applications.

## Overview

This repository contains various exercises, examples, and projects related to ontology development and semantic web technologies. It serves as a learning resource and practice ground for working with ontologies.

## Repository Structure

## Technologies Used

- **OWL** (Web Ontology Language)
- **RDF** (Resource Description Framework)
- **RDFS** (RDF Schema)
- **SPARQL** (Query language for RDF)
- **Protégé** (Ontology editor)
- **Python** (For ontology processing)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of semantic web technologies
- Familiarity with RDF, OWL concepts
- Protégé ontology editor (optional)
- Python environment (for code examples)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NiramaiPNayanar/Ontology_pratice.git
cd Ontology_pratice
```

2. Set up your development environment:
   - Install Protégé for visual ontology editing
   - Install Python libraries if working with code examples:
   ```bash
   pip install rdflib owlready2 SPARQLWrapper
   ```

## Usage
